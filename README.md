My Personal Website
===================

**Description**: This repo contains the styles for my personal website.

You can visit my site @ [www.vinnyaceto.com](http://www.vinnyaceto.com)!  There, you can find my blog as well.

While my site is online and opperational, there are still things I wish to add/fix. One major change is the 
transition to a wordpress template so I can dynamically add content.  I hope to get these modifications done
soon, but I have other projects that I am currently working on.

**TODO:**
..* [ ] Add blog module for medium sized devices
..* [ ] Change transitions for social links
..* [ ] Add picture of myself where I said I would add one, plus add margin to the bottom of that margin
..* [ ] Optimize images: profile image on small devices / put all images on server
..* [ ] Convert to Wordpress theme
..* [ ] Add contact form functionality
